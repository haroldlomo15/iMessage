Working with Firebase.


Firebase is a mobile and web application platform with tools and infrastructure designed to help developers build high-quality apps. It is a realtime database, which provides an API that allows developers to store and sync data across multiple clients.


This is an ios application that uses the power of Firebase as a backend.

The application logs in users or signs up new users using Firebase Authentication and stores the user's profile into the server.

Users can create chat rooms where they can send messages to everyone in that chat room.

Users can also move from one chat room to another and send messages to everyone in any particular chat room
